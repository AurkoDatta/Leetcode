I'm Aurko Datta, a current Computer Science student at McMaster Unviersity.

This repo is where I store all my solutions to LeetCode problems so that its visible to people viewing my profile.
I'm following a Leetcode roadmap called algomap (available at algomap.io) for the order in which I solve LeetCode problems.

Thanks for visiting!!
