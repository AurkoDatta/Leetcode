I'm Aurko Datta, a current Computer Science student at McMaster Unviersity.

This repo is where I store all my solutions to LeetCode problems so that its visible to people viewing my profile. 
I will also add explanations to older solutions at the beginning of each class from time to time to stay on top of things.
If any class is loosely explained, or not explained at all. I will probably be adding the explanations very soon.

I'm following a Leetcode roadmap called algomap (available at algomap.io) for the order in which I solve LeetCode problems.

Thanks for visiting!!

Whether it's to get help to solve your own LeetCode problems or even if you're just looking through my profile, I appreciate the visit.
Feel free to reach out!!
